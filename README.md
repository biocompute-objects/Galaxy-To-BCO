## Purpose
- Map items in the Galaxy schema for history and workflow objects to the [BioCompute Object Schema](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/BCO_Specification/releases/latest)
- Develop tools to automaticlly generate as many values as possible for a BioCompute Object

### Repository
Note that unless you are viewing a [release](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/BCO_Specification/releases) this is a draft subject to change.

Table of content:
* [docs](/docs) - Mapping documents for fields output by Galaxy in JSON and how they could be applied to a BCO. 
* [Galaxy-History-BCO-Test](/Galaxy-History-BCO-Test) - A test set of Galaxy history files
* [test_code](/test_code) - Various WIP python scripts for parsing and or generating a BCO
* [tooShed](tooShed) - a Galaxy tool available in the Galaxy Tool Shed for parsing a workflow file into a partial BCO
